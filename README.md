# Regression-analysis-Ameshousing
This project applies multiple linear regression diagnostics to the Ames Housing dataset, a high-quality alternative to the Boston dataset. Following a structured 14-step modeling pipeline, I performed exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, multicollinearity checks, outlier detection, regression model fitting, and all-subsets model selection in R. The final model explains over 83% of the variance in house prices and meets statistical assumptions. This work demonstrates my skills in R programming, data wrangling, statistical modeling, and data storytelling.
